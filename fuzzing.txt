Fuzzing is black box technique . When we dont have access to code but we can reverse engineer the application or we can send fuzzy data to application to check its behviour

 e.g. of fuzzing spike , sulley , Peachfuzz , Boofuzz
 
since boofuzz is not installed with python 
 pip install boofuzz
 
 
 
 
 from boofuzz import *
 session=Session(target=Target(connection=SocketConnection("<ip>",1337, proto='tcp')))
 
 # our application is running on port 1337 that is the reason for giving 1337 port there 
 
 s_initialize("overflow1")
 s_static("OVERFLOW1")
 s_string("AAAA")
 
 session.connect(s_get("overflow1"))
 session.fuzz()
 
 
 
 Download db browser for sqlite(url: sqlitebrowser.org/dl/) and install it in windows where you can see step by step procedure of sending data to application and when the data was so much that it craashed the application
